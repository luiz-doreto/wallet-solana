- üîê **Secure Authentication**: Google OAuth integration for wallet connection
- üí∞ **Solana Network Support**: Full integration with Solana blockchain
- üì± **Deep Link Support**: Handles wallet connections via deep links

## Tech Stack

- **React Native** - Cross-platform mobile development
- **@solana/web3.js** - Solana Web3 JavaScript API
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe development

## Prerequisites

Before running this project, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [Phantom Wallet](https://phantom.app/) (mobile app for testing)

Extra
- Make sure to be able to execute the project directly on your physical device, this way you can validate the deep links redirection.
- **IMPORTANT**: All the tests and validations were made under `devnet` cluster.
